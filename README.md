Problem Name: Bird Watching

Problem Name - Equality Amongst Elements
Problem Statement: Rohan got an array of integers a[1…n] as a gift. Now he wants to
perform a certain number of operations (possibly zero) so that all elements of the array
become the same (that is, to become a1=a2=⋯=an).
In one operation, he can take some indices in the array and increase the elements of the
array at those indices by 1.
For example, let a=[4,2,1,6,2]. He can perform the following operation: select indices 1,
2, and 4 and increase elements of the array in those indices by 1. As a result, in one
operation, he can get a new state of the array a=[5,3,1,7,2].
What is the minimum number of operations it can take so that all elements of the array
become equal to each other (that is, to become a1=a2=⋯=an)?
